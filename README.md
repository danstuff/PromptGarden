# PromptGarden
PromptGarden connects Google Docs with ChatGPT. It demonstrates usage of the Google Docs API to allow ChatGPT to make live edits to Google documents.

This is a free-to-use sample application and is not currently live hosted, but you can see a semi-non-functional UI demo (here)[https://yostlabs.net/play/pg/].
